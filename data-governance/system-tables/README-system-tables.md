System Tables are a Databricks-hosted analytical store for operational and usage data. 

System Tables can be used for monitoring, analyzing performance, usage, and behavior of Databricks Platform components. By querying these tables, users can gain insights into how their jobs, notebooks, users, clusters, ML endpoints, and SQL warehouses are functioning and changing over time. This historical data can be used to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, track usage patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

Overall, System Tables provide a means to enhance observability and gain valuable insights into the operational aspects of Databricks usage, enabling users to better understand and manage their workflows and resources.

## Accessing your System tables With Unity Catalog 

System Tables are available to customers who have Unity Catalog activated in at least one workspace. The data provided is collected from all workspaces in a Databricks account, regardless of the workspace's status with Unity Catalog. For example, if I have 10 workspaces and only one of them have Unity Catalog enabled then data is collected for all the workspaces and is made available via the single workspace in which Unity Catalog is active.

## System Table Dashboard - Leverage AI with Lakehouse

<img src="https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/product/uc/system_tables/dashboard-governance-billing.png?raw=true" width="600px" style="float:right">

We installed a Dashboard to track your billing and Unity Catalog usage leveraging the System tables.

[Open the dashboard](/sql/dashboards/ab3b5298-e09e-4998-8ef3-ae456a7b888d) to review the informations available for you.<br/><br/>

### A note on Forecasting billing usage

Please note that this dashboard forecasts your usage to predict your future spend and trigger potential alerts.

To do so, we train multiple ML models leveraging `prophet` (the timeseries forecasting library). <br/>
**Make sure you run the `01-billing-tables/02-forecast-billing-tables` notebook to generate the forecast data.** <br/>
If you don't, data won't be available in the dashboard. `dbdemos` started a job in the background to initialize this data, but you can also directly run the notebook. 

*For production-grade tracking, make sure you run your forecasting notebook as a job every day.*
