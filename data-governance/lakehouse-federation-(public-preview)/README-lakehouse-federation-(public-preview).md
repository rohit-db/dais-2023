[Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-lakehouse-federation-capabilities-unity-catalog)

Lakehouse Federation in Unity Catalog allows organizations to build a highly scalable and performant data mesh architecture with unified governance. 

Unity Catalog provides a unified governance solution for data and AI. Lakehouse Federation capabilities in Unity Catalog allow you to discover, query, and govern data across data platforms including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse, Googleâ€™s BigQuery, and more from within Databricks without moving or copying the data, all within a simplified and unified experience. This means Unity Catalog's advanced security features such as row and column level access controls, discovery features like tags, and data lineage will be available across these external data sources, ensuring consistent governance.

Lakehouse Federation addresses these critical pain points and makes it simple for organizations to expose, query, and govern siloed data systems as an extension of their lakehouse. With these new capabilities, you can:

- **Build a unified view of your data estate**: Automatically classify and discover all your data, structured and unstructured, in one place and enable everyone in your organization to securely access and explore all the data available at their fingertips - no matter where it lives.
- **Query and combine all data efficiently with a single engine**: Accelerate ad-hoc analysis and prototyping across all your data, analytics and AI use cases on the most complete data - no ingestion required - with a single engine. Advanced query planning across sources and caching ensures optimal query performance even when accessing and combining data from multiple platforms with a single query.
- **Safeguard data across data sources**: Use one permission model to set and apply access rules and safeguard all your data across data sources. Apply rules like row and column level security, tag-based policies, centralized auditing consistently across platforms, track data usage, and meet compliance requirements with built-in data lineage and auditability.
