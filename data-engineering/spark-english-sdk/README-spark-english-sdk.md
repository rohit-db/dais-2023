- **DataFrame Operations**: The SDK provides functionalities on a given DataFrame that allow for transformation, plotting, and explanation based on your English description. These features significantly enhance the readability and efficiency of your code, making operations on DataFrames straightforward and intuitive.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: The SDK supports a streamlined process for creating UDFs. With a simple decorator, you only need to provide a docstring, and the AI handles the code completion. 
- Caching: The SDK incorporates caching to boost execution speed, make reproducible results, and save cost.
