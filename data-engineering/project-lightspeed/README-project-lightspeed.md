# Project Lightspeed
At the 2022 Data+AI Summit, Project Lightspeed was announced, an initiative dedicated to faster and simpler stream processing with Apache Spark. Lightspeed represents a concerted investment in Spark as the streaming engine of the future, and the Databricks Lakehouse Platform as the best place to run Spark workloads - as well as an acknowledgement of streaming data architectures as the inevitable future of all data.

Project Lightspeed has brought in advancements to Structured Streaming in four distinct buckets. All of these are aimed to make Apache Spark Structured Streaming and the Databricks Runtime increasingly better at handling complex real-time data workloads. 

Here is a summary of whatâ€™s new in Project Lightspeed over the last year, divided by bucket:
